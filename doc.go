Package main - FlightGear MulitPlyer in go

	go-fgms
	------------------------------------------------------
	This is an experiment and silly idea of implementing the
	FlightGear Multiplayer Server (fgms) in golang.

	There are a few challenges and the idea is to copy code line by line from c++ code to golang
	for fun.
	There are major difference and thats the fun ;-)!!!
	"U can skin a cat in may ways"

	Currently is a step by step process, starting with
	- main
	- fg_config
	- fg_tracker
	- et all from there

	There are a few changes
	- isDeamon is gone, instead we expect this app to run with init.d,
	  supervisor, upstart or alike
	- tracker is in its own directory
	- simgear - might be a different project altogether

   Progress:
   - Loads the basic config
   - Replies to telnet
   -

   TODO
   		- Everything else
